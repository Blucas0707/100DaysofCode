1. Data type - String
"123", "abc"
print("123" + "456")

2. Data type - Integer
123, 456
print(123+456)

2. Function - type
num = 213
type(num)

str(num)
type(num)

3. Mathmetical operator
high to low
()
**
* /
+ -

Exercise - BMI

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height = float(height)
weight = float(weight)
BMI = weight / (height * height)
print(BMI)

4. Function - round
limit the digits you want
print(round(8/3, 3)) => 2.667

5. Operator - //
print(8//3) => 2

6. Operator - +=
number = number + 1
=> number += 1

7. f-string
purpose: combine different data types together
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height} and your winning is {isWinning}")

Exerciese - Life in weeks

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
life_left = 90 - int(age)
day_left = life_left * 365
week_left = life_left * 52
month_left = life_left * 12

print(f"You have {day_left} days, {week_left} weeks, and {month_left} months left.")

Exercise - Tip Calculator

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
#HINT 1: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+round+number+to+2+decimal+places+python&oq=how+to+round+number+to+2+decimal
#HINT 2: https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-limit-a-float-to-two-decimal-places-in-python

print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
total_bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip_percentage = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12 or 15? "))
num_people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
each_pay = round(total_bill * (100+tip_percentage)/100 /num_people,2)
each_pay = "{:.2f}".format(each_pay)
# print(f"Each person should pay: ${each_pay}")
print(f"Each person should pay: ${each_pay:.2f}")
